# Test project for company LUDITO

### Implemented features
- Integrated Yandex Maps
- Added search functionality
- Live pin added to select locations on the Map
- Save/Delete locations (with local database)

### Installation guide
For security reasons, I did not add MAPKIT_API_KEY to Github. In order to run the project, you need to provide API_KEY in local.properties.

``` 
### local.properties file

MAPKIT_API_KEY={PROVIDE_API_KEY}
```
